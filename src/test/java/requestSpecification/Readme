RequestSpecification:

It is an interface provided by Rest Assured that helps you set up the basic properties of an HTTP request, such as:
Base URI: The main server URL to send requests to.
Headers: Additional information sent with the request (e.g., content type).
Body: The data payload included in requests like POST or PUT.
Query parameters, cookies, etc.

This RequestSpecificationExample class focuses on creating and managing
a reusable RequestSpecification in Rest Assured for HTTP API testing.
By setting up a common RequestSpecification, the code becomes cleaner and more maintainable
since the base URI, headers, and body setup can be defined once and reused across multiple tests.

SpecificationQuerier and QueryableRequestSpecification are used in Rest Assured
for inspecting the details of a request that has been created.

SpecificationQuerier:
This is a utility class that allows you to query or inspect a RequestSpecification object.
It helps you see what has been set up in the request (e.g., headers, body, base URI).

QueryableRequestSpecification:
This is an object that holds the detailed information of a request after it has been queried using SpecificationQuerier.
It allows you to access and print out properties like the base URI, headers, query parameters, and body content.

In simple terms:

SpecificationQuerier is like a tool you use to examine a built request.
QueryableRequestSpecification is like the report that shows you what the request looks like after you inspect it.
