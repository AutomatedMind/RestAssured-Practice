Serialization:
Serialization is the process of converting a Java object into a format like JSON or XML
so that it can be easily stored, transmitted, or transformed (e.g., when sending data in an API request).

Deserialization:
Deserialization is the reverse process, where data in formats like JSON or XML is converted back into a Java object
so that the program can work with it.

Jackson Library:
The Jackson library simplifies the process of serialization and deserialization between Java objects and JSON.

To use Jackson in your project, you need to include the following dependency in your pom.xml:
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.fasterxml.jackson.core</groupId>
    <artifactId>jackson-databind</artifactId>
    <version>2.15.2</version> <!-- Make sure to check for the latest version -->
</dependency>

POJO Class:
A POJO (Plain Old Java Object) is a simple Java class that follows basic design principles.
It contains fields, constructors, and getter/setter methods.
It does not need to inherit from a specific class or implement specific interfaces.

How to Serialize/Deserialize a POJO Class:
To serialize/Deserialize a POJO class, you can use a library like Jackson's jackson-databind,
which converts the object into a JSON string.

Steps to serialize a POJO class using Jackson:

Create an ObjectMapper instance.
Use the method writeValueAsString() from ObjectMapper to convert the Java object to a JSON string.

Steps to Deserialize a POJO class using Jackson:
Create an ObjectMapper instance.
Use the method readValue() from ObjectMapper to convert the JSON string back into a Java object.
