Authentication and Authorization

Authentication is the process of verifying who someone is (e.g., logging in with a username and password).
Authorization is the process of verifying what access that person has (e.g., which resources or actions they can access based on their roles or permissions).

Example: Netflix Account
Authentication: When you log into Netflix using your email and password.
    This ensures that you are the one who actually owns the account
    and not someone who’s just trying to watch "Friends" without permission.

Authorization: After logging in, Netflix checks if you can access content based on your subscription plan.
 For example:
    A basic plan user can watch on one screen at a time.
    A premium plan user can watch on up to four screens at once,
    so they can share their account with everyone they know... and probably end up paying for it anyway.

Authorization Types:
No auth
Basic auth
API Key
Bearer Token
OAuth

API Key: Similar to a house key that opens the door without needing to prove who you are each time.
Example: A website uses an API key to give you access to its public data without requiring a login.
Bearer Token: Like a concert ticket that grants you access to specific areas or features.
Example: After logging in, your application receives a bearer token, allowing you to access certain API endpoints until the token expires.
OAuth 2.0: Like a VIP pass that grants access after verifying your identity and permissions, usually with an external service (e.g., Google or Facebook).
Example: You log into a third-party app using your Google account. The app gets specific permissions to access your Google calendar but does’t get full access to your account.
