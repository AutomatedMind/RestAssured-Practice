Jayway JsonPath: Jayway JsonPath is a Java library that allows you to extract specific values
from JSON documents, similar to how XPath works for XML.
We use Jayway JsonPath to efficiently query and retrieve values from JSON data,
especially when working with APIs.

Key terminologies used in JsonPath:

$: Represents the root of the JSON document.
.: Dot notation to access properties of an object (e.g., $.store.book).
[]: Used for accessing array elements (e.g., $.store.book[0]).
* (wildcard): Matches all elements in an array or all properties in an object (e.g., $.store.book[*]).
[start
]: Array slicing to retrieve a subset of elements (e.g., $.store.book[0:2]).
?(): Filter expression to filter elements based on a condition (e.g., $.store.book[?(@.price < 10)]).
@: Refers to the current element in a filter expression (e.g., $.store.book[?(@.price < 10)]).

JsonPathException occurs when the specified path in the JSON does not exist or
when you try to access a field or element that is not present.
